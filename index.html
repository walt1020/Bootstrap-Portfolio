			<p>Hello! My name is Ryan, and welcome to my humble portfolio web-page. "Why is this handsome young man staring at me on the left?" you may ask yourself, please, allow me to introdue myself. My name is ryan Walters. I am 22 years old and just graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in May 2017. 
			After receiving my bachelor's degree in political science, I realized that the job options were...broad, to say the least. "Coding seems cool!" I said to myself as I was looking at a project my coding saavy friend was working on, "I wonder if I could learn to do that someday."</p>
			<p>After researching ways in which potentially do so I stumbled upon the coding boot camp at UNC, and I signed up. Now I am <em>developing</em> the skills to be a full-stack web devoloper. See what I did there? Sorry, bad joke. I aspire to be a successful web-developer in the future, and to use the skills I learn from Coding Boot Camp to contribute meaningfully to my company's endeavors.</p>
